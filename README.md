# Weather-Alert-TTS
notifies user of concerning weather conditions

This is a personal project to keep me updated with concerning weather information. I tend to check the weather frequently specifically to monitor for rain, excessive wind, or severe weather alerts.
This was created to give me a bit of peace of mind and to make it easier to stay updated on the weather. I run it headless on a raspberry pi with a speaker, but works great on PC as well. It uses
ffmpeg without opening a display and can be ran in a minimized cmd window for a minimally distracting experience.
